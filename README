This repository contains the current source code for the Kite LLVM "port"
(more like a total rewrite). I hope to avoid many of the mistakes I made
when I wrote the code that would later become the 1.0 release.

version is definitely not nearly ready for prime time. You have been warned.

PREREQUISITES:
--------------
* LLVM >= 2.8 (install the development packages your distro provides)
* C++ compiler (tested on g++ 4.2.1 on OSX)
* Boost Spirit (for parsing)
