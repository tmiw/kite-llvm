This repository contains the current source code for the Kite LLVM "port"
(more like a total rewrite). I hope to avoid many of the mistakes I made
when I wrote the code that would later become the 1.0 release.

Right now, enough of Kite has been implemented to allow for the execution
of simple scripts (see the tests/ folder for details). This version is 
definitely not nearly ready for prime time. You have been warned.

PREREQUISITES:
--------------
* LLVM == 2.8 (install the development packages your distro provides)
* C++ compiler (tested on g++ 4.2.1 on OSX, 4.5.3 on Debian)
* Boost Spirit (for parsing)
* Boehm GC (http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/)

BUILDING:
---------
$ vim Makefile
[modify paths as appropriate]
$ make depend
$ make
[wait several minutes]
$ make test
$ 

USAGE:
------
$ ./kite
"hello world"|print;
^D
hello world
$ ./ikt
