This repository contains the current source code for the Kite LLVM "port"
(more like a total rewrite). I hope to avoid many of the mistakes I made
when I wrote the code that would later become the 1.0 release.

Right now, enough of Kite has been implemented to allow for the execution
of simple scripts (see the examples/ and tests/ folders for details). This
version is definitely not nearly ready for prime time. You have been warned.

PREREQUISITES:
--------------
* LLVM (install the development packages your distro provides)
* Boost Spirit (for parsing)

BUILDING:
---------
$ make
[wait several minutes]
$
